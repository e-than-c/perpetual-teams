      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      Using this website is straightforward. Simply click on the grey text box
      below, then place an object on your space bar—like a rock or a bottle.
      This will keep your Microsoft Teams availability status green, indicating
      you're available to chat with anyone who needs you. Now you are free to
      leave while the object remains on the key. When you return, you can remove
      the object. Ignore the rest of the placeholder text.

        <h3><a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started">React Native</a></h3> 
      <p>
        React Native is a framework that allows you to build mobile applications
        using JavaScript and React. It uses the React library for building user
        interfaces for mobile platforms such as  iOS and Android. Here's how React Native works and its key features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Javascript:</b> React Native enables you to write mobile
          applications using JavaScript and React's component-based
          architecture. React components are reusable UI building blocks that
          manage their own state and can be composed to create complex
          interfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Native Components:</b> React Native uses native components rather
          than web components. It translates React components into native UI
          components specific to each platform, ensuring a native look and feel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cross-Platform</b> React Native allows for code sharing between iOS
          and Android platforms. While you write most of the code in JavaScript,
          platform-specific code (like native modules) can be added when needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Performance:</b> Apps built with React Native typically perform
          well because they use native UI components. React Native also offers
          performance optimization tools and libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Third-Party Libraries:</b> React Native has a vibrant ecosystem
          with numerous third-party libraries and plugins that extend its
          functionality, ranging from UI components to integrations with native
          device features.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://v17.angular.io/docs">Angular</a></h3> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework developed mainly for
        building dynamic web applications. It emphasizes a component-based
        architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components with
        TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript. Angular provides
        powerful features like dependency injection, routing, and form handling,
        making it suitable for building robust and scalable single-page
        applications (SPAs).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Comprehensive Framework:</b> Angular is a full-featured framework
          for building web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>TypeScript:</b> Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript,
          for building robust applications with static typing and enhanced
          tooling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Component-Based Architecture:</b> Angular applications are built
          using components, which are reusable UI elements that encapsulate data
          and behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Single Page Applications (SPAs):</b> Angular facilitates the
          development of SPAs where content is dynamically loaded without full
          page reloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Modularity:</b> Angular applications are organized into modules,
          allowing for easy organization and reusability of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><b>Differences</b></p>
      <p>Here are key differences between React Native and Angular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Platform:</b>React Native targets mobile platforms (iOS and Android),
          whereas Angular is primarily used for building web applications that
          run in web browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Language:</b> React Native uses JavaScript (and optionally TypeScript),
          while Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds
          static typing and other features to enhance development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Development Environment:</b> React Native development requires knowledge
          of mobile development principles and APIs specific to iOS and Android.
          Angular development focuses on web development principles and
          architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Community and Ecosystem: </b> Both React Native and Angular have active
          communities and extensive ecosystems of libraries, tools, and
          resources.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p><b>Relationship</b></p>
      <p>
        React Native and Angular are frameworks designed for different
        purposes—mobile app development and web app development, respectively.
        They are not directly related in terms of technology stack, but
        developers often compare them based on their approach to building
        applications and their ecosystems.
      </p>

    <div>
      <p><b>Choosing Between React Native and Angular</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Use React Native if:</b> You want to build mobile apps that can run
          on both iOS and Android with a shared codebase, prefer using
          JavaScript/React, and need a high level of performance and native-like
          user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use Angular if:</b> You are building web applications that require
          a structured framework with strong opinions on architecture, prefer
          TypeScript for static typing and enhanced tooling, and need extensive
          support for features like routing, forms, and state management.
